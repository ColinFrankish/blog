Rails has been used in Snappygram, Final Project and Quiz on Rails, in repos I have contributed too. Here I am using Rails alone to build a blogging site.

Here I build a simple blog application, allowing people to add messages to a blogsite, and for comments to be made by other visitors to the site. 

Some more advanced styling used to make the sight a bit more presentable ! 

`````shell
run using rails server,  and open in localhost:3000
`````
